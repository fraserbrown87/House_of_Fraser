# House of Frasers

**Goal**
Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You are required to create and manage a Department Store that has different floors and departments, employ staff and sell products to customers.

## Built with:

- Java - object orientated programming language
- JUnit - unit testing framework
- IntelliJ - IDE

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this web app, you will need to be able to require:

- IntelliJ
- SDK version 9.0

### Installing

1. Open IntelliJ
2. Open House_of_Fraser


## Motivation

This web app was created as part of a week long project undertaken while attending CodeClan's 16-week intensive course. At the beginning of the week, we were given four briefs to choose from in which we would implement, consolidate and expand on everything we'd learnt so far.

This included:

- Java fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- SOLID principles
